**Welcome to MoAI!** MoAI is located at Eoui-615, [Dept. of Mechanical System Design Engineering](https://ai.gist.ac.kr){:target="\_blank"}, [SeoulTech](https://www.seoultech.ac.kr/){:target="\_blank"}, Seoul, Republic of Korea.

Our research mainly focuse on motion and action intelligences for robot applications such as navigation and manipulation. Currently, we are focusing on
1. ***Motion Intelligence***, which are essential to recognize surroudings in dynamic environment and generate intelligent robot motion for navigation and manipulation, and
2. ***Action Intelligence***, which makes decisions and generates actions autonomously to complete tasks efficiently by adapting to changing situation based on multi-modal inputs such as vision and langauage.
3. ***Robot Applications***, which applies advanced motion and action intelligences for navigation and manipulation to various robot platforms.
 
 We are always looking for passionate and self-motivated students to join my group. Please reach out to me via email if you are interested in.

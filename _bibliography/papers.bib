abstract = {The present study concerns validation of data-driven modeling for ship dynamics from free-running model test results, in terms of estimation of hydrodynamic force and moment, maneuvering coefficients, and maneuver simulation results. An estimation method for the hydrodynamic force and moment from the acceleration of a surface combatant model ship is suggested and compared with the conventional ship dynamics modeling. The hull dynamics modeling relates the motion and hydrodynamic force and moment is developed by optimizing maneuvering coefficients which leads to minimum loss function of hydrodynamic force and moment and maneuvering criteria. The maneuvering coefficients of the dynamics model is compared with a conventional system-based dynamics model. Lastly, the maneuvering simulation results are compared to the free-running model test results. The suggested model adequately predicts hydrodynamic force and moment in highly coupled sway and yaw motion.}

abstract = {Accurately predicting pedestrian trajectories requires a human-like socio-physical understanding of movement, nearby pedestrians, and obstacles. However, traditional methods struggle to generate multiple trajectories in the same situation based on socio-physical understanding and are computationally intensive, making real-time application difficult. To overcome these limitations, we propose SPU-BERT, a fast multi-trajectory prediction model that incorporates two non-recursive BERTs for multi-goal prediction (MGP) and trajectory-to-goal prediction (TGP). First, MGP predicts multiple goals through generative models, followed by TGP generating trajectories that approach the predicted goals. SPU-BERT can simultaneously understand movement, social interaction, and scene context from trajectories and semantic maps using a single Transformer encoder, providing explainable results as evidence of socio-physical understanding. In experiments, SPU-BERT accurately predicted future trajectories (with 0.19 m and 7.54 pixels of ADE20 for the ETH/UCY datasets and SDD) with over 100 times faster computation (0.132 s) than the state-of-the-art method. The code is available at https://github.com/kina4147/SPUBERT.},

abstract = {Abstract Mobile robots are used in modern life; however, object recognition is still insufficient to realize robot navigation in crowded environments. Mobile robots must rapidly and accurately recognize the movements and shapes of pedestrians to navigate safely in pedestrian-rich spaces. This study proposes real-time, accurate, three-dimensional (3D) multi-pedestrian detection and tracking using a 3D light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point cloud in crowded environments. The pedestrian detection quickly segments a sparse 3D point cloud into individual pedestrians using a lightweight convolutional autoencoder and connected-component algorithm. The multi-pedestrian tracking identifies the same pedestrians considering motion and appearance cues in continuing frames. In addition, it estimates pedestrians' dynamic movements with various patterns by adaptively mixing heterogeneous motion models. We evaluate the computational speed and accuracy of each module using the KITTI dataset. We demonstrate that our integrated system, which rapidly and accurately recognizes pedestrian movement and appearance using a sparse 3D LiDAR, is applicable for robot navigation in crowded spaces.},

abstract = {Abstract Smart cities are expected to provide residents with convenience via various agents such as CCTV, delivery robots, security robots, and unmanned shuttles. Environmental data collected by various agents can be used for various purposes, including advertising and security monitoring. This study suggests a surveillance map data framework for efficient and integrated multimodal data representation from multi-agents. The suggested surveillance map is a multi-layered global information grid, which is integrated from the multimodal data of each agent. To confirm this, we collected surveillance map data for 4 months, and the behavior patterns of humans and vehicles, distribution changes of elevation, and temperature were analyzed. Moreover, we represent an anomaly detection algorithm based on a surveillance map for security service. A two-stage anomaly detection algorithm for unusual situations was developed. With this, abnormal situations such as unusual crowds and pedestrians, vehicle movement, unusual objects, and temperature change were detected. Because the surveillance map enables efficient and integrated processing of large multimodal data from a multi-agent, the suggested data framework can be used for various applications in the smart city.},
